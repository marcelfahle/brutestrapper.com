# The Brutestrapper Manifesto

**Brutestrapper**: A relentless warrior in the startup arena, armed with grit, brains, and an unshakable will. This is bootstrapping with brute force.

- **1. We Embrace the Grind:** We know that success isn't handed out like free samples at a grocery store. Itâ€™s wrestled from the jaws of failure, with blood, sweat, and a healthy dose of cuss words.
- **2. No Bullshit Allowed:** Our bullshit detectors are finely tuned instruments. We cut through the crap, the hype, and the noise. If it doesn't add value, it's out.
- **3. Resourcefulness is our Middle Name:** Limited resources? That's just another way of saying "it's time to get creative." We don't need fancy tools; we need a problem, a brain, and maybe some duct tape.
- **4. Failure is Our Fuel:** We eat setbacks for breakfast. Each failure is a stepping stone, a bloody badge of honor, a story to tell. We don't give up; we get up, learn, and hit back harder.
- **5. Our Network is Our Net Worth:** We know the value of a strong network. It's not about schmoozing; it's about genuine connections, helping others, and building a community of badass Brutestrappers.
- **6. Learning is Non-Negotiable:** Weâ€™re autodidacts, constantly learning, evolving, and adapting. If we donâ€™t know it, weâ€™ll learn it. If it doesnâ€™t exist, weâ€™ll create it.
- **7. Perfection is Procrastination in Disguise:** We believe in action over perfection. Done is better than perfect. We iterate, we improve, but first and foremost, we launch.
- **8. Weâ€™re Fueled by Passion, not Praise:** We donâ€™t work for accolades or pats on the back. Our drive comes from within, from the burning need to create, to solve, to build.
- **9. Our Work Speaks Louder than Our Words:** We let our achievements do the talking. Weâ€™re not here to brag; weâ€™re here to deliver.
- **10. Weâ€™re in it for the Long Haul:** This isnâ€™t a sprint; itâ€™s a marathon... with hurdles... and fire... and possibly sharks. But weâ€™re here for it, every step of the way.

In conclusion, being a Brutestrapper means being a relentless, resourceful, and resilient force in the startup world. It's about embracing the hard, the uncertain, and the downright scary parts of creating something from nothing. So hereâ€™s to the Brutestrappers, the dreamers, the doers, the relentless warriors of the startup world. Keep pushing, keep fighting, and remember â€“ if it were easy, everyone would do it.

Now go out there and brute force your way to success. ðŸš€ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥
